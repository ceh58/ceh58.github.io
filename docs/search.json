    "text": "Aloha! My name is Carmen, and I am a student in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My journey began on the Gulf Coast of Florida, where I fell in love with the ocean. I was inspired to pursue a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke University (2018), after which I quite literally “dove” into opportunities to work and travel all over the world. Some of the highlights include aquaculture in Palau, SCUBA instruction in Indonesia and the Turks and Caicos, and environmental consulting in Hawai’i. When I’m not at work, you can find me in the ocean surfing, sailing, or taking underwater photos!"

    "text": "Professional Experience\nBiologist - AECOS, Kane’ohe, Hawai’i (1/23–7/24)\nAt AECOS, I analyzed and visualized environmental data using R, Python, ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro. I conducted natural resource surveys and collected geospatial data using a Trimble Geo 7x and an Autel Evo II drone. I produced technical reports using Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat, and I worked with clients to produce deliverables in a timely manner.\nSenior Research Assistant – Oceanic Institute at Hawai’i Pacific University Waimanalo, Hawai’i (6/21–1/23)\nWhile working as a Senior Research Assistant, I managed the algae lab and oversaw the installation and operation of two photobioreactors purchased under a federal grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Education. I collected long-term data, developed lab protocols, and was promoted to Senior Research Assistant for showing leadership and proficiency in all departments. Additionally, I created a marketing role for social media updates and outreach on Instagram and Facebook.\nAssistant Manager/SCUBA Instructor – Atlantic Pro Divers, Jacksonville Beach, Florida (5/20–7/21)\nAs Assistant Manager, I monitored store inventory and formulated business newsletters to support marketing and drive sales. I demonstrated excellent customer service and planned PADI courses. I learned how to balance business expenses with profits, and I was given significant authority in shop decisions. When I wasn’t managing the shop, I was teaching the PADI courses that we offered as a 5-star dive center.\nWaterfront Assistant – School for Field Studies, South Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands (8/19–5/20)\nThe Waterfront Assistant role with the School for Field Studies in the Turks and Caicos Islands was a 1-year contract that was cut a few months short due to COVID-19. My role during the program was to conduct and supervise field research as well as guide recreational dives and snorkels for college students. I was responsible for operating and maintaining three Carolina Skiffs and assisting SCUBA courses as a PADI Divemaster. When I was not in or on the water, I fulfilled more administrative roles aiding in the smooth operation of everyday life on campus including outreach to the local community.\nOpen Water SCUBA Instructor – PADI, Gili Trawangan, Indonesia (2/19–8/19)\nI worked as a PADI professional (Divemaster and Instructor) in Indonesia, the Turks and Caicos, and Florida. Since this role spanned different countries, I stayed up to date with PADI’s international rules and regulations to ensure quality control over the courses I taught.\nAquaculture Intern – Indigo Seafood Palau, Inc., Koror, Palau (8/18–2/19)\nThis internship my first introduction to aquaculture. I was responsible for the complete larval rearing of coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) including egg collection, production of live feeds, and hatchery management. I also served as the lead business operator during my time, which included managing finances and other team members.\nLab Technician – Silliman Lab at Duke University Marine Laboratory (8/16–8/17)\nWorking as a summer time Research Technician for the Silliman Lab, I assisted graduate student (now Dr.) Stacy Zhang in the setup and maintenance of large-scale experiments focused on seagrass beds. I was responsible for collecting and recording data both in the field and in the lab in the form of fish surveys and seagrass biomass analysis. I learned crucial steps in the scientific method as well as gained exposure to publications and literature reviews."
