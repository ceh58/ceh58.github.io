    "text": "Aloha! My name is Carmen, and I am a student in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My journey began on the Gulf Coast of Florida, where I fell in love with the ocean. I was inspired to pursue a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke University (2018), after which I quite literally “dove” into opportunities to work and travel all over the world. Some of the highlights include aquaculture in Palau, SCUBA instruction in Indonesia and the Turks and Caicos, and environmental consulting in Hawai’i. When I’m not at work, you can find me in the ocean surfing, sailing, or taking underwater photos!"
