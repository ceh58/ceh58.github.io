    "text": "Aloha! My name is Carmen, and I am a student in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My journey began on the Gulf Coast of Florida, where I fell in love with the ocean. I was inspired to pursue a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke University (2018), after which I quite literally “dove” into opportunities to work and travel all over the world. Some of the highlights include aquaculture in Palau, SCUBA instruction in Indonesia and the Turks and Caicos, and environmental consulting in Hawai’i. When I’m not at work, you can find me in the ocean surfing, sailing, or taking underwater photos!"

In order to calculate this sample statistic, I need to develop a model for damage costs. I am primarily interested in the following variables from the dataset:\n\nyear: the year the storm occurred\nrain_inch: rainfall (inches)\nhighest_wind_speed: max wind speed (mph)\ndamage_usd: damage costs in USD\naffected_areas: list of places affected\n\nI chose these variables because they are storm characteristics that potentially have a relationship with damage costs. While variables such as “fatalities” are likely correlated with damage costs, they are more likely a result of storm intensity rather than a predictor. I also chose to forego category since we are already have a variable for wind speed.\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Cost of damage over time\nggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = year, y = damage_mil, color = factor(category, levels = c(\"TS\", \"Category 1\", \"Category 2\", \"Category 3\", \"Category 4\", \"Category 5\"), labels = c(\"TS\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\")))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Damage (Millions of USD)\",\n       title = \"Damage Costs over Time by Category\",\n       color = \"Category\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Reds\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe category 5 classification encompasses wind speeds of 157+ mph. As an open-ended category, increased damage costs may be associated with an increasing number of category 5 storms. More storms will likely be classified as category 5 due to increasing wind speeds (as a result of increasing storm intensity). So, max wind speed (highest_wind_speed) will likely be the most important predictor in my model. Since rainfall (rain_inch) intensity is also expected to increase with climate change, it will be crucial to include as well.\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Wind speed over time\nwind_time &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = year, y = highest_wind_speed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Max Wind Speed (mph)\",\n       title = \"Max Wind Speed over Time\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept =157,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"firebrick\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Wind vs. damage costs\nwind_damage &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = highest_wind_speed, y = damage_mil)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Max Wind Speed (mph)\",\n       y = \"Damage Costs (Millions of USD)\",\n       title = \"Damage Costs vs. Max Wind Speed\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nwind_time / wind_damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the time period 2000-2014 had 2 category 5 storms while the time period 2015-2023 had 8.\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Rainfall over time\nrain_time &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = year, y = rain_inch)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Rainfall (in)\",\n       title = \"Rainfall over Time\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Rain vs. damage costs\nrain_damage &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = rain_inch, y = damage_mil)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Rainfall (in)\",\n       y = \"Damage Costs (Millions of USD)\",\n       title = \"Damage Costs vs. Rainfall\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nrain_time /rain_damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI created two new variables from areas_affected and year to include in the model. The first one measures the number of places affected, calculated by counting how many “areas” are listed in the areas_affected column from the original dataset. While it seems intuitive that total_areas may increase over time, that isn’t the case (see below). However, there is still a relationship between total_areas and damage_mill, so we will include it. The last factor that I am interested in is time. Since we are looking at change over time, and 2000 is the start of the dataset, I calculated the time variable to be the number of years since 2000 that the storm occurred.\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Number of places over time\nplaces_time &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = year, y = total_areas)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Places Affected\",\n       title = \"Number of Places Affected over Time\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Number of places vs. damage costs\nplaces_damage &lt;- ggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = total_areas, y = damage_mil)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Places Affected\",\n       y = \"Damage Costs (Millions of USD)\",\n       title = \"Damage Costs vs. Number of Places Affected\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nplaces_time / places_damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Damage costs over time\nggplot(hurricane_data_cleaned, aes(x = time, y = damage_mil)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Time (Years since 2000)\",\n       y = \"Damage Costs (Millions of USD)\",\n       title = \"Damage Costs vs. Time\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1, color = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multiple regression equation that I settled on is:\n\\[damage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 wind + \\beta_2 rain + \\beta_3 areas + \\beta_4 time\\]\n\n\nExpand Code\n# Create the model\ndamage_model &lt;- lm(damage_mil ~ highest_wind_speed + rain_inch + total_areas + time, data = hurricane_data_cleaned)\nsummary(damage_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = damage_mil ~ highest_wind_speed + rain_inch + total_areas + \n    time, data = hurricane_data_cleaned)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-26812  -8091  -3670   3719  92553 \n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.
