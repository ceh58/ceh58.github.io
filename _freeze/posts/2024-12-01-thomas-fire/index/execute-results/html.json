The main catalyst for the fire's rapid spread were unseasonably strong Santa Ana winds that brought warm air and low humidity. In the end, 1,063 structures were lost, over 104,607 residents were forced to leave their homes, and damages totaled over $2.2 billion. Lasting environmental effects of the fire included poor air quality (Assignment 2?!) and mudflows during the successive rainy season as a result of the burned vegetation[^1].\n\n[^1]: Read more about the Thomas fire [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire).\n\nThis analysis uses imagery taken by Landsat 8 on January 16, 2018 to highlight the burn scar left by the Thomas Fire after it was considered fully contained (January 12, 2018). By assigning infrared bands to visible colors (short wave infrared to red, near infrared to green, and red to blue), we can easily distinguish the burn scar from the surrounding vegetation. This is because bare earth/dead vegetation reflects swir (short wave infrared), appearing red, and healthy vegetation reflects nir (near infrared), appearing green[^2].\n\n[^2]: Read more about false color imagery [here](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/FalseColor).\n\n# Highlights\n\n- This task explores assigning infrared bands to visible colors to obtain false color imagery.\n\n- Necessary steps include cleaning rasters and filtering geo-dataframes for the desired information.\n\n- It is essential to match Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) of shapefiles and images to obtain the final plot.\n\n# Repository\n\n[Thomas Fire GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ceh58/eds220-hwk4-repeat)\n\n```\n├── data\n│  ├── thomas_fire.cpg\n│  ├── thoams_fire.dbf\n│  ├── thomas_fire.prj\n│  ├── thomas_fire.shp\n│  └── thomas_fire.shx\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── hwk4-task2-false-color-HOYT.ipynb\n└── hwk4-task2-fire-perimeter-HOYT.ipynb\n```\n\n# Dataset Descriptions\n\n#### Landsat Data:\n\nA cleaned, simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, nir, swir) from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 (collected by Landsat 8 satellite).\n\nMicrosoft Open Source, Matt McFarland, Rob Emanuele, Dan Morris, & Tom Augspurger.
